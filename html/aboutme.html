            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! I’m Emil, a passionate rail enthusiast and software developer with a knack for combining my love of trains and technology. Since childhood, trains have fascinated me—their precision, the complexity of rail networks, and the engineering marvels that make rail travel possible. This website is my attempt to bring together fellow train lovers and provide detailed information and resources on everything train-related, from specifications to unique historical facts.</p>
            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>My fascination with trains began during a family trip when I was just five years old. Watching trains zip through the countryside, I couldn’t resist the pull of these powerful machines. Over the years, I’ve dived deep into rail technology, learned about different train systems worldwide, and even traveled to see some iconic railways firsthand. Recently, I started learning programming and realized I could combine my interests, creating a platform for others who share the same passion for trains. This website is the result of that journey, blending technical specs, train trivia, and my own experiences.</p>
            <h2>Contact Me</h2>
            <p>Have any questions, suggestions, or just want to chat about trains? I’d love to hear from you! Reach out through the form below, or connect with me on social media. Let’s keep the rail community growing!</p>
            <h2>Rail Adventures</h2>
            <p>Over the years, I’ve taken every chance to hop on trains around the world, each journey adding something new to my appreciation. Whether it was a quick commuter ride or a scenic route through mountains, every trip reminded me of the magic of rail travel. These experiences fuel my passion and motivate me to share everything I know about trains with others.</p>
